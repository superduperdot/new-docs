  An overview of key resources and concepts used throughout the Brale API docs.
</p>

- [Accounts](/key-concepts/accounts) - Your customers
- [Addresses](/key-concepts/addresses) - A single resource that represents both onchain wallet addresses and offchain fiat accounts. Use address_id everywhere a source or destination is needed.
- [Financial Institutions (Legacy)](/key-concepts/financial-institutions) - Financial accounts that can receive or send funds. Kept for backwards compatiblity - new integrations should use Addresses.
- [Transfers](/key-concepts/transfers) - Convert into, out of, and between stablecoins and fiat
- [Automations](/key-concepts/automations) - A unique bank account number that will send deposited fiat funds to a pre-set onchain address
- [Idempotency](/key-concepts/idempotency) - Ensure each POST request is processed only once
