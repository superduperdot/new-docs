  Brale makes it easy to issue, move, and manage stablecoins. Using our services you can create your
  own stablecoin and leverage our APIs to power on/off ramps, automate payouts, or move stablecoins
  across ecosystems. Brale's APIs support Brale, Paxos, and Circle-issued stablecoins. Stablecoins
  created with Brale are usable for various use cases and can be swapped at any time with other
  popular stablecoins.

Brale offers two complementary APIs:

- `api.brale.xyz` - for secure, programmable stablecoin orchestration
- `data.brale.xyz` - for public token metadata and price feeds

Whether you're a fintech, exchange, or payment platform, Brale provides the infrastructure to build stablecoin-enabled products.
