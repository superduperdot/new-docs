  Brale makes it easy to issue, move, and manage stablecoins. Using our services you can create your
  own stablecoin and leverage our APIs to power on/off ramps, automate payouts, or move stablecoins
  across ecosystems. Brale's APIs support Brale, Paxos, and Circle-issued stablecoins. Stablecoins
  created with Brale are usable for various use cases and can be swapped at any time with other
  popular stablecoins.
