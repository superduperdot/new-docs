title: "Brale Issuance and Orchestration API"
description: "Stablecoin issuance, orchestration, onramps, offramps, and swaps via the Brale API."
---

Brale supports stablecoin issuance and orchestration so you can create, move, and manage stablecoins across chains. Use this API for:

- Stablecoin onramps and offramps (fiat ↔ stablecoin)
- Stablecoin swaps across supported chains
- Custody and payouts
- Programmatic issuance for your own stablecoins

**ID format**: All resource IDs (account_id, address_id, financial_institution_id, automation_id, etc.) are KSUIDs (26-character alphanumeric, time-sortable).

**Version**: 2.3.1

## Base URLs

- Auth: `https://auth.brale.xyz`
- API: `https://api.brale.xyz`

## Authentication

Use OAuth2 Client Credentials to obtain a bearer token, then include it in the `Authorization` header for all requests.

```bash
curl --request POST \\
  --url https://auth.brale.xyz/oauth2/token \\
  --header 'Authorization: Basic ${BASE_64_OF(client_id:client_secret)}' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\
  --data grant_type=client_credentials
```

## Next steps

- Try endpoints in the API reference using the built-in playground.
- Review key concepts (accounts, addresses, transfers, automations) to understand how resources relate.
- See coverage for supported payment methods and blockchains.
