## Core resources

- **Accounts**: Client-owned and managed accounts; IDs are KSUIDs (`account_id`).
- **Addresses**: Universal source/destination primitive. Internal (custodial) vs external (counterparty). IDs are KSUIDs (`address_id`).
- **Automations**: Virtual accounts that map deposits to addresses with specific `transfer_type`/`value_type`. IDs are KSUIDs (`automation_id`).
- **Transfers**: Movements across fiat rails and blockchains; always reference `address_id` for source/destination. IDs are KSUIDs (`transfer_id`).

> IDs are KSUIDs (26-char, time-sortable); case-sensitive. Copy/paste carefully.

## Addresses: internal vs external

- `type=internal`: Brale-custodied addresses (one per supported chain per account); balances available; use for mint/payout flows.
- `type=external`: Counterparty data you register (onchain wallets, offchain bank accounts, Canton parties); no balances.
- Use `address_id` on all transfer endpoints; financial institution IDs are deprecated.

## Value types and transfer types

- `value_type`: Token/fiat identifier (case-sensitive); see [Value Types](/coverage/value-types).
- `transfer_type`: Rail or chain (e.g., `wire`, `ach_credit`, `base`, `solana`); see [Transfer Types](/coverage/transfer-types).
- Always send both on transfers; a custodial address can hold multiple `value_type`/`transfer_type` pairs.

## Idempotency

- Send `Idempotency-Key` on all create POSTs; reuse the same key on retries of the same logical request.
- Do not send `Idempotency-Key` on GETs.

## Automations

- Create virtual accounts that issue deposit instructions and resolve to addresses with specific rails/tokens.
- Useful for mapped deposit flows (e.g., branded onramps) and to avoid manual routing.

## Branding

- Optional statement branding applies to ACH payouts only (`brand`/`branding`); not used for wire/RTP.

## Authentication

- Short-lived bearer tokens (~60 minutes); refresh using `expires_in` before expiry.
- Scope credentials separately for testnet vs mainnet.

## Quick references

- Create external address: `POST /accounts/{account_id}/addresses/external`
- List custodial addresses: `GET /accounts/{account_id}/addresses` (returns `type=internal`)
- Create transfer: `POST /accounts/{account_id}/transfers` (requires `address_id`, `transfer_type`, `value_type`, `Idempotency-Key`)
