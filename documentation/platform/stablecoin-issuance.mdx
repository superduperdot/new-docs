title: 'Stablecoin Issuance'
---

## Overview

Brale issues fiat-backed stablecoins for businesses that want programmable dollars without running their own banking or blockchain stack. You set the program rules; Brale handles mint/burn, custody, settlement, reserves, and reporting.

## Who it’s for

- Fintechs, marketplaces, wallets, and payment platforms that want branded or white-label dollars
- Issuers that need multi-chain support, 1:1 reserves, and compliance controls
- Teams that want APIs first, with dashboards for operations and reconciliation

## How it works

1. **Onboard & scope**: Complete KYB and choose issuance scope (mainnet/testnet), supported rails, and branding.  
2. **Create managed accounts**: Represent your customers or programs; Brale provides custodial addresses on supported chains.  
3. **Fund & mint**: Move fiat in (ACH/wire/RTP) to mint branded stablecoins (e.g., `SBC`, `USDGLO`) to custodial addresses.  
4. **Circulate**: Transfer on-chain or off-chain; configure automations for deposits and payouts.  
5. **Redeem & burn**: Burn to settle redemptions back to fiat rails.  
6. **Monitor**: Use balances, transfers, and webhooks for reconciliation; view reserves and status in-dashboard.

## Guarantees & controls

- **1:1 reserves** for issued supply; transparent reserve visibility.  
- **KSUID identifiers** (`account_id`, `address_id`, `automation_id`) for traceability.  
- **Idempotency everywhere** on POSTs to prevent duplicate mint/burn flows.  
- **Per-chain custody**: internal custodial addresses per chain; external addresses registered per chain/rail.  
- **Branding**: optional statement branding for ACH payouts.  

## Key building blocks

- **Transfers**: mint (fiat → stablecoin), redeem (stablecoin → fiat), and move value across rails.  
- **Addresses**: custodial (internal) for issued tokens; external for counterparties.  
- **Automations**: virtual accounts that route deposits to the right token/chain.  
- **Value types**: canonical token identifiers (see [Value Types](/coverage/value-types)); case-sensitive.
