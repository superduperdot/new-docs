## Overview

Stablecoin orchestration coordinates how funds enter, move, and exit your ecosystem across fiat rails (ACH, wire, RTP) and blockchains. Brale gives you a single API for mint, redeem, swap, and payout flows with custody, automations, and branding controls built in.

## Core capabilities

- **Unified transfers**: Use `address_id` as the universal source/destination across onchain and offchain rails.
- **Multi-rail support**: ACH (same-day/standard), wire, RTP, plus supported chains (EVM, Solana, Stellar, etc.).
- **Automations**: Virtual accounts that route deposits, create addresses, and map to the right `transfer_type`/`value_type`.
- **Branding**: Optional statement branding on ACH payouts.
- **Program controls**: Idempotent POSTs, KSUID IDs, scoped credentials (mainnet vs testnet), and webhook-driven reconciliation.

## Typical flows

- **Onramp**: fiat → stablecoin (mint) to a custodial address, then distribute on-chain.  
- **Offramp**: stablecoin → fiat (redeem) to a beneficiary bank account via ACH/wire/RTP.  
- **Payouts**: ACH with branding, RTP for instant, or on-chain payouts to external wallets.  
- **Cross-chain**: move value between supported chains using source/destination addresses with appropriate `transfer_type`.  
- **Program treasury**: park liquidity in custodial addresses; sweep/redeme as needed.

## Implementation checkpoints

- **Identify rails**: choose `transfer_type` + `value_type` pairs from [Transfer Types](/coverage/transfer-types) and [Value Types](/coverage/value-types).
- **Use internal custody**: fetch custodial addresses (`type=internal`) per chain for mint/payout flows; register external addresses for counterparties.
- **Always send Idempotency-Key** on create POSTs; reuse the same key on retries.
- **Brand ACH payouts** when needed; omit branding for wire/RTP.
- **Monitor & reconcile**: list transfers with pagination; store `id`, `Idempotency-Key`, status, timestamps, and provider refs. Refresh tokens on 401 and retry idempotently.
