title: 'Navigate with Query Parameters'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  You can navigate IO by passing a couple of query parameters in the URL, and having those query
  parameters hydrate the UI with your provided values.
</p>

- Query parameters available:
  - `transfer_type`: The stablecoin you wish to fund and transfer (e.g., `usdglo`, `sbc`). Maps to the `Stablecoin` dropdown in the IO UI.
  - `value_type`: The chain you want to execute the transfer on (e.g., `polygon`, `solana`). Maps to the `Chain` dropdown in the IO UI.

<Warning>
**IO inverts the meanings of `value_type` and `transfer_type` compared to the Brale API.**

In the **API**, `value_type` = the asset/token (WHAT is moving) and `transfer_type` = the rail/chain (HOW it moves). In **IO URLs**, these meanings are swapped. This is an IO-specific convention — do not apply IO naming when integrating with `api.brale.xyz`.
</Warning>

This means you can share a link to a specific transfer configuration with your friends, so
they easily start a transfer.

- Example URL: https://app.brale.io/dashboard?transfer_type=usdglo&value_type=polygon

This results in the following IO UI:
