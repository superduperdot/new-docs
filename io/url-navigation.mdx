title: 'Navigate with Query Parameters'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  You can navigate IO by passing a couple of query parameters in the URL, and having those query
  parameters hydrate the UI with your provided values.
</p>

- Query parameters available:
  - `transfer_type`: This is the stablecoin you wish to fund and transfer. This value can
    be any of the options in the `Stablecoin` dropdown.
  - `value_type`: This is the chain you want to execute the transfer on. This
    value can be any of the options in the `Chain` dropdown.

This means you can share a link to a specific transfer configuration with your friends, so
they easily start a transfer.

- Example URL: https://app.brale.io/dashboard?transfer_type=usdglo&value_type=polygon

This results in the following IO UI:
