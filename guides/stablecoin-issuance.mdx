title: 'Stablecoin Issuance'

<p class="intro-subheading">
  Brale enables businesses to create their own stablecoins in minutes and earn program revenue on
  underlying reserves, managed by Brale. Stablecoins are fully backed by cash, cash equivalents, and
  short-duration U.S. treasuries held in segregated accounts.
</p>

## Overview

Once issued, stablecoins are made available via the API for you and anyone with production API keys (see [Transfers](/key-concepts/transfers), [Automations](/key-concepts/automations)).

## Why create your own stablecoin

Issuance allows businesses to benefit from the treasury economics of a stablecoin and provides additional control not available with third-party stablecoins:

- **Treasury revenue**: Earn treasury revenue on funds at rest. This allows fintechs, emerging ecosystems, and app chains to monetize.
- **Free on and off ramps**: Once issued, your stablecoin is available to your customers to acquire via USD or USDC with $0 fees.
- **Branded**: Create branded, cohesive product experiences leveraging the trust and familiarity of your brand.
- **Issue natively on emerging blockchains**: Issue a native fiat-backed stablecoin on your L1 / L2 / Appchain.

## How to create a stablecoin

Issue natively on 14+ blockchains in less than 10 minutes. Below is a live walkthrough.

## How it works

1. Launch your stablecoin through the Brale dashboard by choosing your name, ticker symbol, logo, and chain(s).
2. The stablecoin will be immediately listed on Brale's exchange and can be acquired via USD or USDC.
3. Brale manages the regulated reserves.
4. Brale shares treasury revenue with you monthly.

## Supported currencies

Brale supports U.S. Dollar and Mexican Peso stablecoins, with additional currencies coming soon. You can also issue stablecoins managed by your own reserves.

## Cross Chain Swaps

Stablecoins are issued natively on each chain and can be swapped 1:1 between chains at any time. Stablecoins are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain. Brale does not use wrapping or locking — all stablecoins are issued natively and enforce natural supply.

### Swap from Solana to Base

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/transfers`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/transfers" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "amount": {
      "value": "100",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "source": {
      "address_id": "'${SOURCE_ADDRESS_ID}'",
      "value_type": "SBC",
      "transfer_type": "solana"
    },
    "destination": {
      "address_id": "'${DEST_ADDRESS_ID}'",
      "value_type": "SBC",
      "transfer_type": "base"
    }
  }'
```

<Note>
Stablecoin issuance is a **dashboard-only flow**. The cross-chain swap shown above uses the Transfers API and requires an existing stablecoin with funded custodial balances. On testnet, use testnet chain names (e.g., `solana_devnet`, `base_sepolia`).
</Note>

## Verification

```bash
# List accounts — confirm your stablecoin's account exists
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"

# List addresses — confirm custodial wallets for your stablecoin
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200. Cross-chain swap requires funded custodial balance.
