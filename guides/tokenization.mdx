title: 'Tokenization Overview'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  This guide is for **tokenization programs** — cases where Brale **does not** manage fiat reserves
  or act as the legal issuer of the token. If you're launching a fiat-backed stablecoin with Brale
  as issuer, see **Stablecoin Issuance** instead.
</p>

<Warning>
**Tokenization endpoints require specific OAuth2 scopes** (`mints:write`, `redemptions:write`, `tokens:read`). Standard API keys may return HTTP 403. Contact Brale to enable tokenization scopes on your API application.
</Warning>

Brale's tokenization API lets you issue and operate your own tokens while using Brale for:

- Mint/burn execution on supported chains
- Account and wallet orchestration
- Key custody
- Unified reporting

In tokenization mode:

- Brale **does not hold reserves** for your token and is not the legal issuer.
- You are responsible for coordinating reserve assets.
- Your tokens are of kind **`attested`**, and can only be used by you (and your managed accounts).
- You do **not** use the USD rails (wire/ACH/RTP) for these tokens.

## Prerequisites

- Bearer token with tokenization scopes
- Your `account_id` with tokenization mode enabled
- An internal `address_id` on the target chain

## When to use Tokenization

Use tokenization when:

- You want to issue a non-USD asset (e.g., basket, points, non-fiat asset).
- You hold and manage the underlying collateral yourself.
- You still want Brale to manage wallets, signing, and on-chain execution.

Use **standard stablecoin issuance** when:

- You want Brale to be the regulated issuer of a fiat-backed stablecoin.
- Brale holds reserves and manages bank relationships on your behalf.

## High-level flow

1. **Account & mode**: Brale marks your main account as **self-attested** (tokenization mode).
2. **Token setup**: Brale configures your token as kind `attested` on the chains you need.
3. **Wallets & balances**: Use the **Accounts** and **Addresses** APIs to read wallet addresses and balances.
4. **Mint / Burn / Transfer**: Use the tokenization endpoints below.
5. **Reporting**: Use `GET /accounts/{account_id}/tokens/transactions` to view all mints, burns, and transfers.

## Minting tokens

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/mints`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/tokens/mints" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "amount": "100",
    "destination": {
      "address_id": "'${ADDRESS_ID}'",
      "value_type": "MY_TOKEN",
      "transfer_type": "base"
    }
  }'
```

## Burning tokens

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/burns`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/tokens/burns" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "amount": "100",
    "source": {
      "address_id": "'${ADDRESS_ID}'",
      "value_type": "MY_TOKEN",
      "transfer_type": "base"
    }
  }'
```

## Verification

| Step | Testnet? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| GET /tokens/mints | Requires scopes | Returns 403 with standard API key |
| POST /tokens/mints | Requires scopes | Returns 403 with standard API key |
| POST /tokens/burns | Requires scopes | Returns 403 with standard API key |
| GET /tokens/transactions | Requires scopes | Returns 403 with standard API key |

```bash
# Testnet: Verify tokenization scope requirement — expect HTTP 403
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/tokens/mints" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

**Expected**: HTTP 403 with standard API credentials. Contact Brale to enable tokenization scopes.
