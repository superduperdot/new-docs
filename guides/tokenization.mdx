title: 'Tokenization Overview'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  This guide is for **tokenization programs** - cases where Brale **does not** manage fiat reserves
  or act as the legal issuer of the token. If you're launching a fiat-backed stablecoin with Brale
  as issuer, see **Stablecoin Issuance** instead.
</p>

Brale's tokenization API lets you issue and operate your own tokens (for example, a local currency stablecoin or a non-fiat asset) while using Brale for:

- mint/burn execution on supported chains,
- account & wallet orchestration,
- key custody,
- and unified reporting.

In tokenization mode:

- Brale **does not hold reserves** for your token and is not the legal issuer.
- You are responsible for coordinating reserve assets
- Your tokens are of kind **`attested`**, and can only be used by you (and your managed accounts).
- You do **not** use the USD rails (wire/ACH/RTP) for these tokens.

## When to use Tokenization

Use tokenization when:

- You want to issue a non-USD asset (e.g., basket, points, non-fiat asset).
- You hold and manage the underlying collateral yourself.
- You still want Brale to manage wallets, signing, and on-chain execution.

Use **standard stablecoin issuance** when:

- You want Brale to be the regulated issuer of a fiat-backed stablecoin.
- Brale holds reserves and manages bank relationships on your behalf.

## High-level flow

1. **Account & mode**

   - Brale marks your main account as **self-attested** (tokenization mode).
   - You may create managed accounts that inherit this mode.

2. **Token setup**

   - Brale configures your token as kind **`attested`** on the chains you care about (e.g., Solana, Base).

3. **Wallets & balances**

   - Use the existing **Accounts** and **Addresses** APIs to create accounts and read wallet addresses and balances.
   - In tokenization mode, **balances** are notional units mapped to any backing currency

4. **Mint / Burn / Transfers**

   - Use the `/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/mint` endpoint to **mint** tokens into a wallet.
   - Use `/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/burn` to **burn** tokens from a wallet.
   - Use `/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/transfers` to move tokens between custodial and external addresses.

5. **Reporting**
   - Use `GET /accounts/{account_id}/tokens/transactions` to view all tokenization mints, burns, and transfers in one place.

Next, see **Tokenization – Mint, Burn & Transfers** for concrete API examples.
