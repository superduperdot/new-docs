title: "Get your custodial address_ids"
description: "List your internal (custodial) addresses to retrieve address_ids for transfers and balances."
---

Use the Addresses API to fetch your custodial `address_id` values. These are required for transfers and balance checks.

## Prerequisites

- Bearer token ([How to authenticate](/key-concepts/authentication))
- Your `account_id` ([How to get your account_id](/guides/how-to/get-your-account-id))

<Steps>
<Step title="List your addresses">

**GET** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/addresses`

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

```json title="Response (200)"
{
  "addresses": [
    {
      "id": "2s55QPf0rp1sSxJToQZxFVhMRy7",
      "name": "on-chain custodial address",
      "status": "active",
      "type": "internal",
      "address": "8ft5hMGTcAcLo25d4Lg5DN9hrYxHHrrTikwQTaQbmMrU",
      "transfer_types": ["solana", "solana_devnet"],
      "created": "2025-01-24T15:29:38.525556Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "2s55O6n4oPThB79KsN2ZIfvCHDt",
      "name": "on-chain custodial address",
      "status": "active",
      "type": "internal",
      "address": "0x5FAc869cD6ae8AfbA0903dce21EC6857b26F5fF1",
      "transfer_types": ["amoy", "arbitrum", "avalanche", "base", "base_sepolia", "ethereum", "polygon"],
      "created": "2025-01-24T15:29:19.930557Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Pick the right address_id">

- Filter for `type: "internal"` to get custodial addresses managed by Brale.
- Choose an address that supports the `transfer_type` you need (e.g., `solana`, `base`, `ethereum`).
- Use the `id` field as `address_id` in transfers and balance queries.
- EVM chains (ethereum, base, polygon, arbitrum, avalanche, etc.) share one address. Non-EVM chains (solana, stellar, algorand, etc.) each get their own.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For balances, pair the `address_id` with both `transfer_type` and `value_type` in the balance endpoint.
</Tip>

## Verification

```bash
# List addresses — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200 with an `addresses` array. Each address has `id`, `name`, `status`, `type`, `address`, `transfer_types`, and `created`.
