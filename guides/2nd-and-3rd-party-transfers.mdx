title: '2nd & 3rd Party Transfers'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  We've expanded the Transfers endpoint to support both 2nd and 3rd party ACH transfers.
</p>

<Warning>
**ACH branding requires mainnet.** The 2nd/3rd party branding feature uses ACH rails which cannot be tested on testnet. The API shape (the `brand` field in transfer requests) can be validated, but actual branded ACH transactions require mainnet credentials and real bank accounts.
</Warning>

When Brale initiates a transfer on behalf of your business or your customer's business, 2nd/3rd-party branding ensures the **receiver sees the intended business name** on the ACH transaction (instead of "Brale").

To learn more and see a demo, schedule a meeting to [talk to sales](https://brale.xyz/contact).

## Prerequisites

- Bearer token ([How to authenticate](/key-concepts/authentication))
- Your `account_id` and any managed client `account_id`s
- An ACH-linked address for the source (Plaid or manual)
- An internal custodial `address_id` for the destination

## Creating 2nd/3rd Party Transfers

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/transfers`

Use the `brand` object to control the business name displayed to the receiver. Pass the target account inside the request body under `brand.account_id`.

- **2nd-party**: `brand.account_id` = your own account. Display name = your business.
- **3rd-party**: `brand.account_id` = your customer's account. Display name = your customer's business.

If you omit `brand`, the transfer uses your default branding.

<Note>
The `brand` field is only supported on ACH transfers (`ach_credit` and `ach_debit`). It is not supported for `wire` or `rtp_credit`.
</Note>

### Example: 2nd Party Transfer (brand = your business)

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/transfers" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "amount": {
      "value": "100",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "source": {
      "value_type": "USD",
      "transfer_type": "ach_debit",
      "address_id": "'${ACH_SOURCE_ADDRESS_ID}'"
    },
    "destination": {
      "value_type": "SBC",
      "transfer_type": "canton",
      "address_id": "'${INTERNAL_ADDRESS_ID}'"
    },
    "brand": {
      "account_id": "'${YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'"
    }
  }'
```

### Example: 3rd Party Transfer (brand = your customer)

```json title="Request"
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "value_type": "USD",
    "transfer_type": "ach_debit",
    "address_id": "${ACH_SOURCE_ADDRESS_ID}"
  },
  "destination": {
    "value_type": "SBC",
    "transfer_type": "canton",
    "address_id": "${INTERNAL_ADDRESS_ID}"
  },
  "brand": {
    "account_id": "${CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_ID}"
  }
}
```

## Verification

| Step | Testnet? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Validate `brand` field accepted in request | **No (mainnet only)** | ACH rails required |
| List accounts (verify managed accounts) | Yes | Can verify account_ids exist |
| List addresses (verify ACH addresses) | Yes | Can verify address types |

```bash
# Testnet: List accounts to verify brand target exists — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```
