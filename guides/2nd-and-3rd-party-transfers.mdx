title: '2nd & 3rd Party Transfers'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  We've expanded the Transfers endpoint to support both 2nd and 3rd party ACH transfers.
</p>

When Brale initiates a transfer on behalf of your business or your customer's business, 2nd/3rd-party branding ensures the **receiver sees the intended business name** on the ACH transaction (instead of “Brale”).

## Creating 2nd/3rd Party Transfers

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers`

Use the `brand` object to control the business name displayed to the receiver. Pass the target account inside the request body under `brand.account_id`. The `brand.account_id` is the **Account whose name should appear** to the receiver.

- `account_id: aB3hJkL9mN2PqRsTuvWxyz1234` = `Company Alpha`
  - Your business (Brale's direct customer)
- `account_id: 34fcsGrCgN0Z9zC1v55eP0I6AKW` = `Company Beta`
  - Your customer

If you omit `brand`, the transfer uses your default branding.

> **Definitions**
>
> - **2nd-party**: You are the brand (display name = your business).
> - **3rd-party**: Your customer's business is the brand (display name = your customer).

### Example of a 2nd Party Transfer (brand = your business)

`brand.account_id` = `aB3hJkL9mN2PqRsTuvWxyz1234` (Company Alpha)

The receiver will see **Company Alpha** as the name on the ACH transaction.
