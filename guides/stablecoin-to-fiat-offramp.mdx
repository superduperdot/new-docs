title: 'Stablecoin to Fiat (Offramp)'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  Brale makes it easy for you and your customers to convert stablecoins into USD via Wire transfer,
  ACH, and RTP.
</p>

<Warning>
**Fiat rails (wire, ACH, RTP) require mainnet.** The offramp flows in this guide cannot be fully executed on testnet because they require real bank infrastructure. You can validate the address creation API shape on testnet, but actual fiat payouts require mainnet credentials and a registered bank account.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- Bearer token ([How to authenticate](/key-concepts/authentication))
- Your `account_id` ([How to get your account_id](/guides/how-to/get-your-account-id))
- An internal (custodial) `address_id` holding stablecoins
- An external offchain `address_id` linked to a bank account (created below)

## Step 1: Link an Address to your customer's Account

You can add addresses in two ways:

1. **Addresses API** — manually provide bank details
2. **Plaid** — link via Plaid flow

Here is an example of directly adding an offchain address.

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/addresses/external`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses/external" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{
    "owner": "Jane Doe",
    "account_number": "1234567890",
    "routing_number": "987654321",
    "name": "Example Bank",
    "transfer_types": ["ach_credit", "same_day_ach_credit", "rtp_credit"],
    "beneficiary_address": {
      "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
      "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "90001"
    },
    "bank_address": {
      "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
      "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "90001"
    },
    "account_type": "checking"
  }'
```

```json title="Response (201)"
{
  "id": "34yxvqP90NfeeYkQGriO6bSfn1K",
  "name": "THE BANK OF TAMPA",
  "owner": "Jane Doe",
  "status": "active",
  "transfer_types": null,
  "created": "2025-11-03T19:57:25.965990Z",
  "account_number": "****7890",
  "needs_update": false,
  "routingNumber": "063108680",
  "account_type": "checking"
}
```

<Note>
**Known runtime behavior**: `routingNumber` uses camelCase (inconsistent with the snake_case convention). `transfer_types` may be `null` initially — the available rails are determined asynchronously.
</Note>

### RTP Enablement

Offramps via RTP use the `rtp_credit` transfer_type on the destination Address. RTP capability is enabled asynchronously, so a newly created bank Address may initially not show `rtp_credit` even though it is eligible. Only treat an Address as RTP-capable once `"rtp_credit"` appears in its `transfer_types`.

## Step 2: Submit a Stablecoin to USD Transfer

### Stablecoin to USD via Wire

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/{account_id}/transfers`

```json title="Request"
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "address_id": "${INTERNAL_ADDRESS_ID}",
    "value_type": "SBC",
    "transfer_type": "solana"
  },
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "${BANK_ADDRESS_ID}",
    "value_type": "USD",
    "transfer_type": "wire"
  }
}
```

Brale will burn the stablecoins from the source address immediately, then transfer USD to the destination bank account.

## Verification

| Step | Testnet? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Create offchain address (bank) | Yes | Address is created with bank details |
| List financial institutions | Yes | FIs are visible |
| Submit wire offramp | **No (mainnet only)** | Requires real bank account to receive funds |
| Submit ACH credit offramp | **No (mainnet only)** | Requires real bank account |
| Submit RTP offramp | **No (mainnet only)** | Requires RTP-enabled bank account |

```bash
# Testnet: List FIs to verify bank addresses exist — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/financial-institutions" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```
