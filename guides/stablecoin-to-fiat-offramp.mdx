title: 'Stablecoin to Fiat (Offramp)'
---

<p class="intro-subheading">
  Brale makes it easy for you and your customers to convert stablecoins into USD via Wire transfer,
  ACH, and RTP.
</p>

In order to submit a stablecoin-to-fiat transaction, first you need to:

- Create an [Account](/key-concepts/accounts) respresenting your customer
- Create an [Address](/key-concepts/addresses) which is your customer's bank account where Brale will deposit USD
- Deposit stablecoins to a Brale custodial address (address with type `internal`)

## Link an Address to your customer's Account

You can add addresses in two ways:

1. Addresses API
2. Plaid

Here is an example of directly adding an offchain address.

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/addresses/external`

```json title="Request"
{
  "owner": "Jane Doe",
  "account_number": "1234567890",
  "routing_number": "987654321",
  "name": "Example Bank",
  "transfer_types": ["ach_credit", "same_day_ach_credit", "rtp_credit"]
  "beneficiary_address": {
    "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
    "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "90001"
  },
  "bank_address": {
    "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
    "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "90001"
  },
  "account_type": "checking"
}
```

}
```

### RTP Enablement

Offramps via RTP use the `rtp_credit` transfer_type on the destination Address. RTP capability is enabled asynchronously by our banking partner, so a newly created bank Address may initially not show `rtp_credit` even though it is eligible for real-time payments. Only treat an Address as RTP-capable once `"rtp_credit"` appears in its `transfer_types`. See **Key Concepts → Addresses → Create External Address for RTP** for details.

## Stablecoin to USD via Wire

Once your customer has anAddress and stablecoins are held in a Brale controlled address, you can submit a Transfer request with the destination of the address.

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers`

```json title="Request"
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "address_id": "2VcUIonJeVQzFoBuC7LdFT0dRe4",
    "value_type": "YSBC",
    "transfer_type": "Solana"
  },
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "2AbCdEfGHiJkLmN0pQrStUvWxYz",
    "value_type": "USD",
    "transfer_type": "wire"
  }
}
```

Brale will burn the stablecoins from the Source Address immediately, and then transfer USD to the destination bank account.
