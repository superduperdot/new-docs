<p class="intro-subheading">Hold stablecoins on behalf of your end customers.</p>

Brale enables businesses to hold fiat-backed stablecoins on behalf of their end users — unlocking powerful digital dollar experiences for wallets, marketplaces, fintech apps, and neobanks. Use stablecoins as account balances, enable fast transfers, or power embedded payouts.

<Info>
Custody is available to approved business Accounts operating in supported geographies. It is not available for individuals.

## Prerequisites

- Bearer token ([How to authenticate](/key-concepts/authentication))
- An approved business account with custody enabled

## What It Does

Custody lets you:

- Create and manage custodial wallets for end users
- Hold stablecoin balances across all supported chains
- Initiate transfers and payouts directly from custodied funds
- Earn revenue share on idle balances of Brale-issued stablecoins

All Brale Accounts support custodial wallets on all supported chains out of the box — no custom wallet infrastructure required.

## Who It's For

Use cases include:

- Wallets that want to show balances and enable transactions
- Neobanks offering digital dollar accounts
- Marketplaces holding funds for sellers or escrow
- Fintech platforms embedding payments or savings

## How It Works

1. **Create Wallets**: When you [register an Account](/key-concepts/accounts), custodial wallets are created automatically on all supported chains. No additional setup required.
2. **Receive Deposits**: You or your users can send stablecoins directly to custodial wallet addresses. [Fetch wallet addresses](/key-concepts/addresses) and fund them.
3. **Track Balances**: Use the [Balances endpoint](/api-reference/brale/get-address-balance) to query stablecoin holdings across all wallets and chains.
4. **Initiate Payouts**: Send funds from any custodial wallet using the [Transfers](/key-concepts/transfers) endpoint. Supports on-chain transfers, off-chain payouts, and cross-chain swaps.
5. **Earn Revenue Share**: When using your own stablecoin, you earn a share of revenue on all custodied assets.

## Verification

```bash
# List accounts (shows managed accounts) — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"

# List addresses for an account — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -w "\nHTTP: %{http_code}" \
  "https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/addresses" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200 with `accounts` array and `addresses` array. Internal addresses have `type: "internal"`.
